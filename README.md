## Why I did this homework

The objective of this homework is to improve accessibility on an existing site. Accessibility is defined as a product, designed to make it easier for those with disabilities to use. To do this, I had to refactor the HTML and CSS file provided without changing what it does.

## What I learned

Some of the reasons accessibility is important is

* It helps people with disabilities and screen readers understand and navigate through the web.
* It improves inclusion on the web. Making it not only easier for people with disabilities but also older people and those with slower internet connections
* It will improve the placement of sites on search engines.

 A way to improve accessibility is to use semantic tags. Semantics make it easier to understand the purpose of a tag and will make your codes more organized. 

## HTML refactors

* Changed <div class=”content”> to <header>.
* Changed <div> in <header> to <nav>.
* Changed <div class="hero"></div> to <figure> and removed class.
* Changed <div class=”content”> to <main>.
* Changed <div> in <main> to <section>.
* Changed class in <sections> within <main> to “content”.
* Added missing <id> to <img> on line 34.
* Added alt to images in <main>.
* Changed <div class=”benefits”> to <aside>.
* Changed <div> within <aside> to <section>.
* Changed <section> class to benefit on all.
* Added alt to images in <aside>.
* Changed <div class=”footer”> to <footer>.

## CSS refactors

*Added comments to label each section and selectors.
*Consolidating repeating sections that gave the same styling to multiple tags.
*Removed unnecessary class selectors.
